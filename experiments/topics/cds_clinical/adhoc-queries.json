On examination he is cyanotic, tachypneic, with a barrel shaped chest and diffuse rales over his lungs. A chest x-ray is notable for hyperinflation with no consolidation.",

Blood pressure was 199/108 mm Hg, respiratory rate 18 bpm, oxygen saturation 98% on ambient air. The heart sounds were rapid and with no murmurs. CK-MB was 10.9 ng/ml, CK was 89 U/l, CK index was 12.2% and Troponin T was 0.40 ng/ml. An EKG showed sinus regular tachycardia of 119 bpm, with ST-segment elevations up to 3 mm in V1, V2, and V3. A chest radiograph showed low lung volumes and right basilar subsegmental atelectasis. Coronary angiography showed no stenosis or clinically significant disease. Left ventriculography revealed akinesis of the anterior wall, hypokinesis of the apical and distal inferior walls, and compensatory hyperkinesis of the basal anterior and basal inferior walls. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed severe segmental left ventricular dysfunction involving the septum, anteroseptal territory, and apex. The overall left ventricular systolic function was mildly impaired and there was mild mitral regurgitation.",

Further investigations reveal mild iron deficiency. She already receives iron supplementation. The obstetrician repeats the complete blood cell count 2 weeks later. The Hb is 8.9 g/dL, WBC count 7.1 x 109/L, and platelets 108 x 109/L. She describes difficulty swallowing. A reticulocyte count is performed and found elevated at 180 x 109/L. The obstetrician requests a hematology consult. The following additional results were found: Negative DAT, normal clotting screen, elevated LDH (2000 IU/L), normal urea and electrolytes, normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT), anisocytosis, poikilocytosis, no fragments, no agglutination, polychromasia and presence of hemosiderin in the urine.",

He is unable to dress, bathe, use the toilet, or walk independently. On examination the patient's temperature was 36.5\u00b0C (97.7\u00b0F), the heart rate 61 bpm in an irregular rhythm, the blood pressure 144/78 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate 18 bpm. The patient was alert and oriented to self and city but not year. He frequently interrupted the examiner. He repeatedly reached out to grab things in front of him, including the examiner's tie and face. He could not spell the word \"world\" backward, could not follow commands involving multiple steps and was unable to perform simple calculations. His speech was fluent, but he often used similar-sounding word substitutions. He could immediately recall three out of three words but recalled none of them after 5 minutes. Examination of the cranial nerves revealed clinically significant paratonic rigidity. Myoclonic jerks were seen in the arms, with symmetrically brisk reflexes. The reflexes in the legs were normal.",
